# DMOJ_Projects
Holds code I used to solve problems in DMOJ that are 10 points or greater.

I have learnt a lot since staring DMOJ mainly - 
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Theory
- BSTs
- Segment trees and prefix sums
- Suffix Trees

I also improved my coding skills in both Python 3 and Java.

This is me!
